# Design Decisions

## Data Flow and State Management

Our Anamnesis Form Management System is designed with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and performance. Here are the key design decisions regarding data flow and state management:

### 1. React Components and Hooks

We use functional React components with hooks for state management within components. This approach provides a clean and efficient way to handle component-level state and side effects.

Key benefits:
- Improved code readability
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Better performance through optimized re-renders

Example:
```jsx
const [forms, setForms] = useState<AnamnesisForm[]>([]);
const [globalFilter, setGlobalFilter] = useState('');
```

### 2. Client-Side Filtering and Pagination
To improve performance and reduce server load, we implement client-side filtering and pagination using libraries like @tanstack/react-table.

Key benefits:

Faster user interactions
Reduced server load
Enhanced user experience with quick filtering and sorting

### 3. Debouncing for Performance Optimization
We implement debouncing techniques, especially for search functionality, to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API calls.

Key benefits:

Improved application performance
Reduced server load
Better user experience

```jsx
const debouncedSearch = useCallback(
  debounce((term: string) => {
    fetchAnamnesisFormList(term).then(setForms);
  }, 300),
  []
);
```
